For this purpose, the transfer learning method has been used, and with high accuracy and a very good F1 score, it can distinguish a CT scan photo of a healthy lung from a cancerous lung and also identify the type of cancer.

                    <p>Getaround is an online car sharing service that connects drivers who need to book a car with owners who share their cars for a fee. This project is divided into two parts.
                        In the first part, exploratory data analysis has been done to understand the importance of canceled rents, and in the second part, a model has been created that shows the optimal rental price to users, and finally, an EDA dashboard has been built with Streamlit. It is deployed with Docker & Heroku
                        And an API has been created that integrates a connected model with AWS and MLflow and deploys it with Docker & Heroku.

                        From the Kaggle dataset description:
    
                        This dataset was compiled by professors Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar for their 2006 paper Gender Differences in Mate Selection: Evidence From a Speed Dating Experiment.
    
                        Data was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four minute “first date” with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.
    
                        The dataset also includes questionnaire data gathered from participants at different points in the process. These fields include: demographics, dating habits, self-perception across key attributes, beliefs on what others find valuable in a mate, and lifestyle information.
